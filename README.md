# Project Battleship ðŸš¢

My first project during Ironhack bootcamp.

The goal was to create a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript 2 weeks after learning the fundamentals.

I decided to go for a boardgame (battleship, with a twist !) and not make it a two player game but integrate a kind of AI.




## Features

- Rudimentary AI, planned on making it smarter but ran out if time as we had 5 days to implement our idea.
- Random generation of the player and computer ships position.
- Originally wanted to make a drag and drop for the ships but decided to resort on randomness.
- Instead of shooting once per turn, you can target one cell per ships alive you own (starting at 5), making the first few turn quicker and progressively harder.

  
## Issues

Not responsive, not compatibe with mobile, can have targeting issues.
